        <h2>Introducing the Riot Gauntlet at Undercity Nights</h2>
        <p>We see you out there on the internet, showing off your strats and talking a big game, but are you ready to put your coins where your comp is?</p>
        <p>The Riot Gauntlet is a two day contest of skill and well-intended smack-talk as we pit global players against each other AND a crack team of Rioters across all of our games.</p>
        <p>The winners will be richly rewarded with bragging rights and the ability to put portions of a $100,000 prize pool towards a charitable cause of their choice.</p>
        <p>Beginning at 4:30pm PT on November 19th, player teams will face off against each other across three rounds.</p>
        <p>Five out of six team members will play the round’s primary game, while the sixth member (the real hero) will play that round’s bonus game for additional opportunities to up their prize pool.</p>
        <p>Beginning at 1:00pm PT On November 20th, the main event begins. Our captains will put aside their differences to face off against the true villains: Riot’s balance teams.</p>
        <p> Instead of a team of generalists, Riot will be offering up multiple rosters of our best, brightest, and definitely-not-boosted across three rounds to put our players to the test.</p>
