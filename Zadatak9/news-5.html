        <h2>Undercity Nights Takes Over</h2>
        <p>Now that Piltover’s elite have wrapped up the Progress Day celebration, it’s time for the undercity to come out to play.</p>
        <p>Piltover might not see it, but the undercity is just as vibrant as topside in its own unique way. You’re about to see it first hand.</p>
        <p>Welcome to Undercity Nights! </p>
        <p>With two acts of Arcane out now, the finale is coming up quicker than a Firelight’s hoverboard. While you wait, we‘ll have new content, more events, and plenty of shimmer-infused surprises from November 14-20. The week of Undercity Nights culminates in a two-day live broadcast, community celebration that brings the undercity to life on November 19 and 20, with Arcane’s Act 3 midnight (PT) release as the marquee event. </p>
        <p>In League, Preseason 2022 comes to the Rift with the debut of new items, an Inspiration Keystone, Objective Bounties, and Hextech and Chemtech Drakes. And don’t forget you can earn Arcane Vi by playing three games or winning one!</p>
        <p>VALORANT’s newest Agent finally makes his appearance on November 16. If Chamber wasn’t already intimidatingly-handsome enough, his tattoos literally turn into guns.</p>
        <p>Over in TFT, the meta for Set 6 is settling a bit and all the Chemtech synergies are perfect to get you into the mood for Undercity Nights. On November 17 we’re introducing Double Up, a new game mode where you can play with a buddy and share the experience of rerolling all your gold in search of that crucial Viktor to lock in your comp.</p>
